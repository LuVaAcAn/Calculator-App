# üßÆ Calculator App

A simple and elegant calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The app is styled using modern CSS techniques and utilizes JavaScript for its functionality.

## üìÑ Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: HTML and CSS.

### HTML

The HTML defines the structure of the application. Here are the main components:

-   **Main Container**: A `div` with the class `container` that wraps all elements.
-   **Presentation**: A `div` with the class `presentation` that includes a title for the app.
-   **Subcontainer**: A `div` with the class `subcontainer` that contains the calculator.
-   **Calculator**: A `div` with the class `calculator` that contains:
    -   **Form**: A `form` element that contains all the input buttons and the display.
    -   **Display**: A `div` with the class `display` that contains an input text field to show the current input and result.
    -   **Buttons**: Multiple `input` elements with type `button` that represent the calculator's buttons for digits, operators, and functions (AC, DE, =).

### CSS

The CSS defines the style and appearance of the application. Here are the highlights:

-   **General Style**: Uses the "Poppins" font, a dark background, and a modern color scheme.
-   **Container**: Centers the content vertically and horizontally.
-   **Calculator**: Styles the calculator background, padding, and border-radius.
-   **Input Buttons**: Styles the buttons with a specific width, height, border-radius, box-shadow, background gradient, font size, and color.
-   **Display**: Styles the display input to align text to the right and increase the font size for better readability.
-   **Special Buttons**: Styles the equal button (`#equal`) to have a larger width.

## üìÇ File Structure

The project has the following file structure:
calculator-app/
‚îÇ 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
### HTML

The `index.html` file defines the structure of the user interface.

### CSS

The `style.css` file contains all the styles and rules for the application.

## üöÄ Features

-   **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

-   **CSS**: For styling and creating a modern look.
